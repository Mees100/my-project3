# My third project - Show and filter a list

## This app demonstrates my knowledge of:

1. Sass usage
   - nesting properties
   - nesting selectors
   - variables
   - mixins
   - default arguments
   - structure
2. usage of fetch to get data from a webserver
   define types of: - the json response body - return - use async code with promise and then - use the filter method - use async code with promise and then - use useEffect with a dependency
3. Common dev tools:
   - use prettier and eslint to keep code readable
   - use a bundler (vite) to build and develop with automatic reloading

## Deploy

Run the following commands to deploy

- `npm run build`
